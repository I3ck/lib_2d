add more interpolations (splines)

sweep algorithms

add speed tests?

make interpolations methods of Path?

minimum bounding rectangle

intersects_with should check whether the minimum bounding rectangles intersect, first

intersections_with should first call whether it intersects then

maybe do those checks only if a minimum number of points is reached

add option to convex hull and bounding box whether they should be closed (see Arc or Ellipse)
