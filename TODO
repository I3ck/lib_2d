BEFORE NEXT RELEASE
    remove all topological dependend methods from PointCloud

    Topology => size_t vec which defines how "big" an element is

    PointCloud <- Path <- SpecificPath
    PC => only points
    Path => path from Point1 to PointN
    SpecifictPath => some path using some Points (e.g. convexHull of a PC)

    todo all algorithms using topological containers should only use points marked within these
    this way, it is really easy to combine filters etc.

    delete copy and assign of all types with pointers (topological may should simply copy the old topology and the shared ptr to parent, since this is fine)

    make parent a const in topolocial container?

    there are still missing spline algorithms

    add to_file etc to topological containers (add interfaces for these methods since they are used heavily)

    cleanup all code
    get rid of debug outputs
    switch to lgpl?
    => V 1.0


FIXES / IMPROVEMENTS:
    test whether ellipse is actually rotated around its center instead of 0 0 (when constructing, same goes for others)
    size_t for all indexes?
    convex hull
    tests for LDouble failing (segmentation fault)
    inline smaller functions

    add more interpolations (splines)
