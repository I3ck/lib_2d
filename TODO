BEFORE NEXT RELEASE
    remove all topological dependend methods from PointCloud

    rename TPC to OrderedPointCloud

    delete copy and assign of all types with pointers (topological may should simply copy the old topology and the shared ptr to parent, since this is fine)

    cleanup all code
    get rid of debug outputs
    => V 1.0


LATER

    use inline in all often-called methods

    there are still missing spline algorithms

    make parent a const in topolocial container?

    Topology<2> PC => LineSegments

    todo all algorithms using topological containers should only use points marked within these
    this way, it is really easy to combine filters etc.

    add to_file etc to topological containers (add interfaces for these methods since they are used heavily)

    ICP : iterative closest point (might be reasonable to combine this with cppOpt (or in higher order lib)


FIXES / IMPROVEMENTS:
    test whether ellipse is actually rotated around its center instead of 0 0 (when constructing, same goes for others)
    size_t for all indexes?
    convex hull
    tests for LDouble failing (segmentation fault)
    inline smaller functions


SHOULD BE ADDED:

    add more interpolations (splines)

    sweep algorithms
